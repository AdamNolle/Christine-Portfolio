      <h1>Hi! I’m Christine <br> nice to meet you.</h1>
      <p>
        My counseling style is warm and non-judgmental. I integrate kindness and I believe in treating others with respect, sensitivity, and compassion, and I don’t believe in stigmatizing labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach combines client-centered therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition to working with an approach to focus on strengths that you have. We will identify them together and use them to create what you want and need in your life.
